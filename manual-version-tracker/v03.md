ShockTheBlock Atom Game - Development Documentation
Major Changes Implemented (Chronological Order)
1.
Git Repository Initialization

Initialized Git repository with git init
Added all project files to Git
Created initial commit with message "Initial commit: ShockTheBlock Atom game v0.1"
Added files: game-fixed.js, game.js, index.html, styles.css
2.
Semantic Versioning Implementation

Created first semantic version tag v0.1 with message "Version 0.1: Initial game implementation"
Added GAME_VERSION constant to game-fixed.js initialized to 'v0.1'
3.
Version Display in UI

Modified displayPerformanceMetrics function to show game version
Added version display at coordinates (10, 20) in the game canvas
Adjusted Y-coordinates of other metrics (FPS, Physics, Collision, Render) to accommodate the new version display
Adjusted block and particle count display positions
4.
Version Metadata in Code Files

Added version metadata header to game-fixed.js with game title, version, and features list
Added version metadata header to index.html
Added version metadata header to styles.css
5.
Git Hooks for Version Automation

Created .git/hooks directory
Implemented post-tag Git hook to automatically update version numbers in files when a new tag is created
Made post-tag hook executable
Implemented pre-commit Git hook to ensure version consistency across files
Made pre-commit hook executable
6.
Custom Dialog Implementation

Added isDialogOpen flag to track dialog state
Created custom dialog component in HTML
Implemented showDialog function to replace native alerts
Modified fire button event listener to check dialog state
Added event handling for dialog dismissal
7.
Documentation

Created README.md with project details, version information, and instructions
Documented version control system, hooks, and usage
8.
Three-Phase Gameplay Implementation

Created UI containers for the three gameplay phases
Implemented Phase 1 - Targeting Setup with horizontal ball positioning
Implemented Phase 2 - Power Calibration with 4 distinct power levels
Implemented Phase 3 - Execution with dynamic velocity-based tail effect
Positioned all UI elements 25% closer to right edge for better visibility
Implemented visual indicators for active phase
Created fluid transitions between phases
9.
Bug Fixes

Fixed ball visibility issue by correcting script reference in index.html from game-fixed.js to game.js
Added explicit init() call at the end of game.js to ensure proper game initialization

Notable Issues and Corrections
1.
Performance Metrics Display

Issue: Adding version display shifted other metrics positions
Correction: Adjusted Y-coordinates of all metrics to maintain proper spacing
2.
Dialog Implementation

Issue: Native alerts blocked game execution and didn't match game styling
Correction: Implemented custom dialog with proper styling and non-blocking behavior
Issue: Dialog state wasn't being tracked, allowing actions during dialog display
Correction: Added isDialogOpen flag and checks to prevent actions when dialog is open
3.
Version Consistency

Issue: Potential for version inconsistency across files
Correction: Implemented pre-commit hook to verify version consistency
4.
Ball Visibility

Issue: Ball was not visible in the game
Correction: Fixed script reference in index.html from game-fixed.js to game.js
Correction: Added explicit init() call at the end of game.js to ensure proper initialization

7.
Three-Phase Gameplay Flow

UI containers for each phase
Phase 1: Targeting Setup with horizontal positioning
Phase 2: Power Calibration with 4 distinct levels
Phase 3: Execution with dynamic velocity-based tail effect
Visual indicators for active phase
Fluid transitions between phases
The ShockTheBlock Atom game now features a complete three-phase gameplay flow with clear visual separation between phases, intuitive controls for each phase, dynamic visual effects that respond to player choices, and smooth transitions between gameplay states. The ball visibility issue has been fixed, and the game is fully functional with all UI elements properly positioned and responsive.
