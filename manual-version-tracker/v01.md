ShockTheBlock Atom Game - Development Documentation
Major Changes Implemented (Chronological Order)
1.
Git Repository Initialization

Initialized Git repository with git init
Added all project files to Git
Created initial commit with message "Initial commit: ShockTheBlock Atom game v0.1"
Added files: game-fixed.js, game.js, index.html, styles.css
2.
Semantic Versioning Implementation

Created first semantic version tag v0.1 with message "Version 0.1: Initial game implementation"
Added GAME_VERSION constant to game-fixed.js initialized to 'v0.1'
3.
Version Display in UI

Modified displayPerformanceMetrics function to show game version
Added version display at coordinates (10, 20) in the game canvas
Adjusted Y-coordinates of other metrics (FPS, Physics, Collision, Render) to accommodate the new version display
Adjusted block and particle count display positions
4.
Version Metadata in Code Files

Added version metadata header to game-fixed.js with game title, version, and features list
Added version metadata header to index.html
Added version metadata header to styles.css
5.
Git Hooks for Version Automation

Created .git/hooks directory
Implemented post-tag Git hook to automatically update version numbers in files when a new tag is created
Made post-tag hook executable
Implemented pre-commit Git hook to ensure version consistency across files
Made pre-commit hook executable
6.
Custom Dialog Implementation

Added isDialogOpen flag to track dialog state
Created custom dialog component in HTML
Implemented showDialog function to replace native alerts
Modified fire button event listener to check dialog state
Added event handling for dialog dismissal
7.
Documentation

Created README.md with project details, version information, and instructions
Documented version control system, hooks, and usage
Current Implementation Status
Core Game Features
✅ Physics-based ball movement with gravity and friction
✅ Object pooling for particle effects
✅ Performance monitoring with FPS and timing metrics
✅ Custom dialog implementation (replacing native alerts)
✅ Git-based version tracking system
Version Control System
✅ Git repository initialization
✅ Semantic versioning (v0.1)
✅ Version display in game UI
✅ Version metadata in code files
✅ Git hooks for version automation
UI Components
✅ Game canvas with block-breaking gameplay
✅ Stats panel showing balls and score
✅ Controls for angle and power adjustment
✅ Fire button with particle effects
✅ Custom dialog for game messages
Notable Issues and Corrections
1.
Performance Metrics Display

Issue: Adding version display shifted other metrics positions
Correction: Adjusted Y-coordinates of all metrics to maintain proper spacing
2.
Dialog Implementation

Issue: Native alerts blocked game execution and didn't match game styling
Correction: Implemented custom dialog with proper styling and non-blocking behavior
Issue: Dialog state wasn't being tracked, allowing actions during dialog display
Correction: Added isDialogOpen flag and checks to prevent actions when dialog is open
3.
Version Consistency

Issue: Potential for version inconsistency across files
Correction: Implemented pre-commit hook to verify version consistency

Documentation

README.md with project details and instructions
Code comments and metadata
The ShockTheBlock Atom game now has a fully functional version control system integrated with Git, allowing for easy tracking of versions and automatic updating of version information throughout the codebase. The custom dialog implementation provides a more integrated user experience compared to native browser alerts, and the performance monitoring system gives valuable insights into game performance.
